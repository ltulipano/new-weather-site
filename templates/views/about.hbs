        HI, I'M ERIKA I am a coffee fanatic from northern Illinois who now lives
        in southeast Wisconsin with my husband and dog. I started my photography
        journey while traveling to national parks to photograph wildlife and
        landscapes. I am a people person (and have ADORABLE nephews and a
        BEAUTIFUL niece), so it wasn't surprising that family photography quickly
        followed.
